When I wrote this initially, I wasn't online, so I couldn't tell how much I was reinventing the wheel.

I find these scripts useful, though. Put them in /bin/ and call them from vim.

Checking online now, it appears that this exact featureset is unique, but vim-fugitive ( https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive ) is better for the general case (but works very differently). As a quick-fix tool at the directory level for situations where pulling a remote repository isn't an option, this is probably a useful example.
