" Rather than call opening a new window and calling !!gg yourself, you can be lazier if this is in your .vimrc:

function New_scratch_window(shell_command)
	new
	set buftype=nofile
	let b = append(0, systemlist(shellescape(a:shell_command)))
	0
endfunction
com Gg call New_scratch_window("gg")
com Lg call New_scratch_window("lg")
